I'll focus on words that might be commonly misspelled or could be similar to other words in typing patterns.\n\nFor the prompt \"What are the names of some famous actors that started their careers on Broadway?\", here are three reasonable word changes:\n\n1. Changing \"actors\" to \"factors\" - This could happen if you missed the 'a' key, as 'f' is nearby on a keyboard. \"What are the names of some famous factors that started their careers on Broadway?\" still makes grammatical sense, though it changes the meaning to ask about influential elements rather than people.\n\n2. Changing \"started\" to \"starred\" - These words are very similar with just one letter different. \"What are the names of some famous actors that starred their careers on Broadway?\" is grammatically correct and contextually similar.\n\n3. Changing \"Broadway\" to \"Boardway\" - This looks like a misspelling where 'oa' replaced 'roa'. \"What are the names of some famous actors that started their careers on Boardway?\" would read as if referring to a misspelled Broadway.\n\nOptions:\nWhat are the names of some famous factors that started their careers on Broadway?\nWhat are the names of some famous actors that starred their careers on Broadway?\nWhat are the names of some famous actors that started their careers on Boardway?"

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the scarcity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains.

I'll focus on words that could plausibly be typos or autocorrect errors while keeping the sentence coherent.\n\nFor my options, I'll select:\n\n1. Change \"script\" to \"scrip\" - This could happen if you missed the 't' at the end. A scrip is a small document or certificate, so asking to \"Write a scrip for a YouTube video\" is less common but still makes reasonable sense.\n\n2. Change \"exploring\" to \"exporting\" - This could be an autocorrect error if you mistyped a few letters. While \"exporting the history\" is less common than \"exploring,\" it could reasonably mean presenting or transferring knowledge about jazz history.\n\n3. Change \"jazz\" to \"jams\" - This is a plausible autocorrect error and still keeps the sentence coherent, as \"jams\" can refer to musical improvisations, which would be related content for a YouTube video.\n\nOptions:\nWrite a scrip for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz.\nWrite a script for a YouTube video exporting the history and cultural significance of jazz.\nWrite a script for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jams."
